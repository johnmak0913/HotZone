# HotZone
## Overview
***HotZone*** is a web application developed with Django, Python and JavaScript. 

The application aims at providing the staff in the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) a solution to record the locations visited by covid-19 positive patients. The collected data can then be clustered with the *Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)* algorithm to identify potential hot zones of virus transmission.
